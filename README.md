Project Description 
In this project you need to implement graph algorithms. You will be building a graph network. 
In addition, you will need to build a profession and title dictionary. After that you will need to 
code and implement test cases for graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s and strongly 
connected components. More details about these will be given below. 
 Project Package 
For this project, you will be given a few files that you need to work with. Those files include the 
one dataset files, two skeleton code files, and one python code file to run the test cases. The 
testing python script tells you how many test cases your code passed and failed. 
 Dataset
 
For this project you will be using the imdb_network.csv. The required data is 
extracted and provided as CSV file.
(1) Imdb_network.csv file
 The dataset file includes the following attributes as columns.
tconst – a unique identifier for each movie
nconst – a unique identifier for each person 
primaryTitle – popular title that is used for promotions 
primaryName – name by which a person is often credited 
primaryProfession – top 3 professions of a person 
 Skeleton codes 
(1) Graph_creation.py
This python skeleton code file has the functions defined for creating title, profession
dictionary, adding nodes, edges and graphs. Detailed comments are provided on what 
you need to code and where to write the code 
(2) graph_algorithms.py 
This python skeleton code file needs to be used to implement the bfs, dfs, Dijkstra and 
kosaraju algorithms. Comments on what you need to do and “Need to Code” comments 
are provided. Read the comments carefully and complete the code. 
 Testing scripts 
A testing script named ‘graph_testcases.py’ is provided. You do not have to write 
any code in this file. This file has all the test case functions called. And you can run this 
file to check and test your code as running this file gives you how many test cases your 
code passed or what testcases your code failed. 
 
Project Instructions 
Graph_testcases.py: 
This Python file will execute your codes and check whether the provided test cases are 
passed or failed. 
Graph_creation.py 
 Start implementing the graph_creation.py file. 
This file will be used for creating two dictionaries and adding nodes, edges and creating 
graph. 
This file contains a function _create_title_dict () where you will need to create a 
dictionary. The key values will be the nconst (of actor or director) and the 
values field will be a list of movies (primaryTitle’s) the actor or director is involved in. 
 In the _create_profession_dict () you will need to create a dictionary where keys will be 
nconst and the values will be corresponding actor or director. An example dictionary is 
mentioned as a comment in the code. 
 In the movie network class of the same file you will need to implement 3 functions 
 In the add_node () function you will need to add nodes to the graph. The nodes will be 
nconst values. It takes node as argument. 
 In the add_edge () function you will need to add edges to the graph. It takes node1, 
node 2, nconst_ar_dr, and weight as arguments. Node 1 and Node 2 are the two end 
nodes for the edge, nconst_ar_dr is profession dictionary you constructed above, and 
weight is the number of common movie titles between the two nodes. The result should 
be a dictionary where key is nconst (Node 1) and value is again a dictionary with key 
representing other nconst (Node 2) and weight as the value. 
 Before adding Edge weights you must follow the below Instructions: 
1) The weight of the edges should be greater than 2 
2) Node 1-> Node 2 relation can be that of a director -> actor, but not that of an actor -> 
director. Again, detailed example of this is provided as a comment in the code of 
get_graph function. 
3) Bi-directional edges should be added if both Node1 and Node2 are of same category 
either both are actors, or both are directors. For example: If Node 1 is of actor, then 
Node 2 should also be of actor and if Node 1 is of director, then Node 2 should also be 
of director. More details are provided as comments in the code. 
 In create_graph () function you need to create a graph by following the proper edge 
weights and node conventions as mentioned. More details are provided as comments in 
the code. 
Graph_algorithm.py 
 This file has 4 functions you need to code. 
 The bfs () function takes a graph which is a dictionary representing the graph, 
start_node which represents the node where the transversal needs to start, 
search_node which is the node to be searched (optional) as arguments. 
 This bfs function needs to implement the breadth first search algorithm and should 
return the list of visited nodes in order during the search. But if the search_node is 
mentioned then you need to return 1 if the search node is found and 0 if the search 
node is not found. 
 Note: In BFS If the given start_node belongs to one strongly connected component then 
the other nodes belong to that particular component can only be traversed. But the 
nodes belonging to other components must not be traversed if those nodes were not 
reachable from the given start_node.
 The dfs () function takes a graph which is a dictionary representing the graph, 
start_node, which is the starting node of transversal, visited which is the set of visited 
nodes, path which is list of nodes in the current path and search_node which is the node 
to be searched (optional) as arguments. And this function needs to implement the 
depth first search algorithm. 
 The function should return a list of nodes visited in the order they area visited during 
the search. But if the search_node is given then you need to return 1 if the node is 
found, 0 if the node is not found. 
 Note1: The optional parameters “visited” and “path” are initially not required to be 
passed as inputs but needs to be updated recursively during the search implementation. 
If not required for your implementation purposes they can be ignored and can be 
removed from the parameters. 
 Note2: In DFS If the given start_node belongs to one strongly connected component 
then the other nodes belong to that particular component can only be traversed. But 
the nodes belonging to other components must not be traversed if those nodes were 
not reachable from the given start_node.
 Next you need to implement Dijkstra algorithm in Dijkstra () function. This function 
takes graph, start_node and end_node as arguments. Graph is a dictionary representing 
the graph with keys as nodes and values as dictionaries with edges and their weights, 
start_node is the node where search should start, end_node is the node we want to 
reach. 
 The function returns 0 if the end node is not reachable from the start node. If the end 
node is reachable then the function needs to return a list containing 3 elements in the 
order mentioned below - 
1) Shorted path from start_node to end_node. Meaning it is again a list of nconst values 
in the visited order. 
2) Total distance of the shortest path – which is the summation of edge weights 
between minimum visited nodes. 
3) Hop count between start and end nodes. 
 Next you need to implement the Kosaraju () function. This calculated the strongly 
connected components. It takes graph as an input argument and needs to return - 
1) List of strongly connected components. Each component is again a list of nconst 
values.
